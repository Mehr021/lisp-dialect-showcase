## üìñ Introduction

Lisp is a family of programming languages with a rich history and a unique syntax. This repository serves as a platform for showcasing various dialects of Lisp. By examining different implementations of common algorithms, you can appreciate the strengths and characteristics of each dialect.

## üóÇÔ∏è Lisp Dialects

This project features several popular Lisp dialects:

- **Clojure**: A modern, functional language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It emphasizes immutability and concurrency.
  
- **Common Lisp**: A versatile and powerful dialect that offers a rich set of features and libraries. It's widely used in academia and industry.
  
- **Emacs Lisp**: A dialect used primarily for scripting within the Emacs text editor. It allows users to extend and customize their editing experience.
  
- **Fennel**: A Lisp that compiles to Lua. It provides a familiar syntax for Lua developers while retaining Lisp's powerful features.
  
- **Hy**: A Lisp dialect that compiles to Python. It allows developers to write Python code with Lisp syntax, making it a bridge between two worlds.
  
- **Janet**: A small, embeddable Lisp that focuses on simplicity and performance. It is designed for scripting and embedding in applications.
  
- **Racket**: A descendant of Scheme, Racket is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. It supports functional programming and provides powerful tools for language creation.
  
- **Scheme**: A minimalist dialect of Lisp that emphasizes a small set of features and a clean syntax. It is often used in educational settings.

## üîç Common Algorithms

In this repository, you will find implementations of several common algorithms across different Lisp dialects. Some of these algorithms include:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Explore how each dialect implements sorting techniques like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort.

- **Search Algorithms**: Examine implementations of algorithms such as Binary Search and Depth-First Search.

- **Data Structures**: Learn about various data structures like linked lists, trees, and hash tables.

- **Mathematical Algorithms**: Discover implementations of algorithms for calculating Fibonacci numbers, prime numbers, and factorials.
